# As Cardano Rosetta is mostly some queries and data mapping it makes no sense to mock repository
# queries as, after that, it's just some data mapping nad that's it. In order to test our queries
# we can populate the test db with some real mainnet data. We are already importing a mainned snapshot
# but using a whole mainnet snapshot will be huge (+3GB) so, alternatively, we selecting and importing
# some blocks data. It's not an ideal solution as we need to relax some constraints to do so
# but still is better than inserting data manually. This script uses a similar process as 
# `pg_dump` using COPY statements
#
# This script helps dumping some information based on block ids.
#
# To run this file, grab a mainnet db-sync postgres db and execute
#
# $ bash dump_blocks.sh
#
# A resulting file like `fixture_data.sql` can then be either importer or compressed `tar` to be used
# in our e2e tests
