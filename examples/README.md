# Description

In this repository some examples can be found.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THEM IN MAINNET, OR USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## Requirements

1. `yarn` installed on your system.
1. Launch `cardano-rosetta` server at port `8080`.
1. Install the dependencies:

```javascript
yarn install
```

## Transaction sending

It generates an address based on a predefined private key, asks for funds and once found the address is drained and sent to a specific address.

Important notes:

- `PRIVATE_KEY` will be used to derive the address.
- You can request for testnet funds using the following [faucet](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/cardano/tools/faucet/).
- Funds will be sent to `SEND_FUNDS_ADDRESS` by default as it's the address where testnet funds should be returned.

In order to execute the example, run:

```javascript
$ yarn send-transactions-example
```

Output will look like:

```bash
$ ts-node ./send-transaction-example.ts
